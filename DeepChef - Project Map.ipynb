    "For those recipes that miss these, we can determine how many people a recipe serves, and how many of the thing it yields, using recipes that have these values. For example, for the recipes that have `Serves` values, since this seems to be a function of `RecipeIngredientParts` and `RecipeIngredientQuants`, we can train a model with the independent variables consisting of these two columns, and the target variable beging `Serves`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then apply this model to determine the missing `Serves` values of the other recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model should probably be based on KNN or K-Means algorithms. We want to assign a `Serves` value to a recipe based on the `Serves` value of the recipes with *similar* `RecipeIngredientParts` and `RecipeIngredientQuants`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we should encode the items in `RecipeIngredientParts` into numbers, and then train the model on pairs of (a,b), where a is the quantity of an item and b is its numerical representation, to predict the servings number.\n",
